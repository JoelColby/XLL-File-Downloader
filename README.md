## Usage

Download the `XLL-File-Downloader.ps1` script to your computer. Run it by right-clicking it and selecting "Run with PowerShell"

The output of the script is a folder called "xlabs" which contains all of the files necessary for the launcher to run, as well as an `xlabs.exe` file.

The "xlabs" folder must be moved to local AppData (%localappdata%), as this is the location that the X Labs Launcher executable will look for the files.
